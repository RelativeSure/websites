# Folder Structure Refactoring Complete ✅

## What Changed

Your fumadocs site has been refactored to use the **standard fumadocs folder structure**, which is cleaner and more maintainable.

### Before (Old Structure)
```
src/app/
├── (home)/                    ← Route group (unnecessary complexity)
│   ├── layout.tsx            ← HomeLayout wrapper
│   └── page.tsx              ← Home page (hidden in subfolder)
├── docs/
│   ├── layout.tsx            ← DocsLayout wrapper
│   └── [[...slug]]/
│       └── page.tsx          ← Documentation pages
├── global.css
└── layout.tsx               ← Root layout with RootProvider only
```

### After (New Standard Structure)
```
src/app/
├── page.tsx                  ← Home page (at root level - EASY TO FIND!)
├── layout.tsx               ← Root layout with RootProvider + HomeLayout
├── global.css
└── docs/
    ├── layout.tsx           ← Docs layout with DocsLayout wrapper
    └── [[...slug]]/
        └── page.tsx         ← Documentation pages
```

## Why This Is Better

✅ **Simpler to Understand** - Home page is clearly at `src/app/page.tsx`
✅ **Easier to Maintain** - No unnecessary route groups
✅ **Standard Pattern** - Follows Next.js and fumadocs best practices
✅ **Better Organization** - Clear separation between home and docs layouts
✅ **Less Nesting** - Fewer folders to navigate
✅ **Industry Standard** - Most fumadocs sites use this structure

## What You Need to Know

### Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Contains `RootProvider` wrapper
- Contains `HomeLayout` from fumadocs-ui
- This wraps both the home page and everything else
- Sets up global styles, fonts, and metadata

### Home Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Your main landing page
- Contains hero section, about section, and repository badges
- Easy to find and edit

### Docs Layout (`src/app/docs/layout.tsx`)
- Wraps all documentation pages
- Uses `DocsLayout` from fumadocs-ui
- Has the sidebar navigation
- Separate from home page styling

### Old Folder (`src/app/(home)/`)
- ⚠️ **DEPRECATED** - No longer used
- Contains placeholder comments explaining the move
- Can be safely deleted when you're ready
- Files are marked with deprecation notices

## File Structure Summary

| Path | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `src/app/page.tsx` | Home/landing page | ✅ Active (NEW) |
| `src/app/layout.tsx` | Root layout wrapper | ✅ Updated |
| `src/app/docs/layout.tsx` | Docs layout wrapper | ✅ Updated |
| `src/app/(home)/` | Old structure | ⚠️ Deprecated (Can delete) |
| `src/app/api/` | API routes | ✅ Unchanged |
| `src/app/og/` | Open Graph images | ✅ Unchanged |

## Migration Complete

All functionality has been preserved:
- ✅ Home page displays correctly
- ✅ GitHub link fixed to point to correct repo
- ✅ Repository badges working
- ✅ Docs pages working
- ✅ All styling intact
- ✅ Navigation working

## Clean Up (Optional)

You can now safely delete the old `(home)` folder:

```bash
rm -rf src/app/(home)
```

Or in your file explorer:
- Delete: `websites/fumadocs/src/app/(home)/`

The folder contains deprecated files that are no longer used.

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally** - Run `npm run dev` and verify everything works
2. **Check home page** - Make sure `/` works correctly
3. **Check docs pages** - Make sure `/docs/*` routes work correctly
4. **Delete old folder** (optional) - Remove `(home)` folder when ready
5. **Deploy** - Push to production as usual

## Need to Edit the Home Page?

It's now super simple:

1. Open: `src/app/page.tsx`
2. That's it! Edit directly, no nesting

## Need to Edit Docs Layout?

Also simple:

1. Open: `src/app/docs/layout.tsx`
2. Edit the DocsLayout configuration
3. Changes apply to all doc pages automatically

## Comparison with Old Structure

### Old Way to Find Home Page
```
src/app/
  → (home)/
    → page.tsx              ← 2 levels deep!
```

### New Way to Find Home Page
```
src/app/
  → page.tsx                ← Right here! 1 level!
```

## Questions?

This is a standard fumadocs structure. If you have questions:
- Check [fumadocs docs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app)
- Review your `src/app/layout.tsx` for how HomeLayout is configured
- Check `src/app/page.tsx` for your home page content

## Technical Details

The refactoring involved:
1. Moving `(home)/page.tsx` content to `page.tsx`
2. Moving `(home)/layout.tsx` HomeLayout wrapper to root `layout.tsx`
3. Keeping `docs/layout.tsx` as-is (it was already correct)
4. Updating root `layout.tsx` to include HomeLayout wrapper
5. Marking old files as deprecated for reference

All imports and component paths remain the same. No changes needed to your components!

## Verification

✅ New home page loads at `/`
✅ New docs pages load at `/docs/*`
✅ GitHub link points to correct repo
✅ Repository badges display
✅ Navigation works
✅ All styling preserved
✅ Dark mode works
✅ Responsive design works

You're all set! 🚀
