This page is primarily for use on how I setup different parts of my website. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I make changes to my website.

## Disable line numbers

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. Use `<Code>` block. As seen here:

   [https://expressive-code.com/key-features/code-component/](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/code-component/)

2. Follow the installation on Line Numbers here:

   [https://expressive-code.com/plugins/line-numbers/](https://expressive-code.com/plugins/line-numbers/)

3. Add `meta="showLineNumbers=false"` to the `<Code>` block or the Markdown code block.

   ```mdx showLineNumbers=false
   <Code code="add code here" lang="shell" meta="showLineNumbers=false" />
   ```

   ````mdx showLineNumbers=false
   ```mdx showLineNumbers=false
   alternative way
   ```
   ````

4. Line numbers will **not** be shown on the code block.

</Steps>
