# Gitleaks Ignore File
# Add false positives here to prevent them from blocking commits
# Format: You can add file paths or commit hashes

# Example: Ignore specific files
# test-data.json
# mock-credentials.ts

# Example: Ignore specific finding by adding the gitleaks fingerprint
# This fingerprint is shown when gitleaks detects a secret

# Common false positives in web development
# Placeholder API keys in examples or documentation
# Test data with fake credentials
# Public keys or tokens that are meant to be public

# To add an exception:
# 1. Run: pre-commit run gitleaks --all-files
# 2. Copy the fingerprint from the output
# 3. Add it below

# You can also use inline comments in your code:
# const apiKey = "fake-key-for-testing"; // gitleaks:allow
